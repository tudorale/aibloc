# Landing page for Ai Bloc SAAS

## What is this?
This website is for an UpWork client, a open-source landing page for the Ai Bloc Start Up where I worked for a week, from Jul. 5, 2021 till Jul. 11, 2021.

## Case Study 
Ai Bloc is a non-code platform where you can build Data Science and Machine Learning programs, the client wanted a good and beautiful landing page for this start-up.

At first, I started designing a wireframe in Figma, the client was happy about it and then we went to the coding process. I used mainly React JS as the best option as the client was fine with it, I used also different libraries such as GSAP, AOS, Typed.js for animations. The illustrations from the landing page were edited in Adobe Photoshop to match the color scheme. 

The landing page turned out as a beautiful responsive website with animations and a great user experience.

## Preview 
To view this website I recommend you to clone the repository, download the files locally, run `npm install` and then start your react server, `npm start`.
